# PulseCheck-App

The project aims to leverage the ubiquitous presence of mobile phones equipped with optical sensors to develop an embedded system for heart rate monitoring. Traditional heart rate monitors often require dedicated hardware or wearable devices, which can be cumbersome and expensive. By utilizing the existing hardware in smart-phones, this project seeks to provide a convenient and cost-effective solution for individuals to monitor their heart rate using just their mobile device's led and camera. By leveraging the ubiquitous presence of smart-phones, which are now integral parts of daily life for many individuals, the project aims to provide a non-invasive and user-friendly alternative for heart rate monitoring.
